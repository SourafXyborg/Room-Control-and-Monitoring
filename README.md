# Room-Control-and-Monitoring




Room Control and Monitoring System is an IoT-based project that allows users to control and monitor their room's environment using a mobile application. The project uses an MIT App Inventor to build the mobile application and connects to a real-time database using Firebase to store and retrieve data. The system is capable of controlling two LEDs using on-off buttons provided on the mobile application and monitoring the temperature and humidity of the room using a DHT11 sensor. The temperature and humidity values are displayed in real-time on the application.

The system is scalable and can be extended to control other home appliances by replacing the LEDs with relays. With the help of relays, users can control real home appliances like a fan or light using the mobile application. The project can be used as a prototype for a smart home automation system.

Features:

Two LEDs control using mobile application
Temperature and humidity monitoring using a DHT11 sensor
Real-time data display on the mobile application
Scalable and can be extended to control other home appliances using relays
Technologies Used:

MIT App Inventor
Firebase Realtime Database
DHT11 Sensor
NodeMCU(esp8266)
LEDs
To use this project, the user needs to connect the DHT11 sensor and LEDs to the Arduino Uno board, connect the Arduino Uno to the computer using USB, and upload the code to the board. The mobile application can then be installed and used to control the LEDs and monitor the temperature and humidity values of the room.

Overall, the Room Control and Monitoring System is an excellent project for students and hobbyists interested in IoT and home automation. The project is open source and available on GitHub for anyone to use and modify.
